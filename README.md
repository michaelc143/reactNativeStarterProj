### Welcome to my first react native project for IOS development!

In order to run the application, first clone the repository using the following
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelc143/reactNativeStarterProj.git
```

Then run the following command to start the developement server
```bash
npx expo start
```

My recommendation is to use your personal device to work on. This can be done using the Expo go application available at [this link](https://expo.dev/client)
